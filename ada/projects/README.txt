                     Example Projects for building programs

   You can copy one of these project files to default.gpr in your project
   directory. If you wish to use make for your top level build command,
   instead of gprbuild, you can also copy Makefile to your project
   directory as well. (Be sure to replace @@YOURPROGRAMS@@ in Makefile
   with your list of programs.)
