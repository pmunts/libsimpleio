# RabbitMQ Ada Client Library Notes

22 December 2025 -- Imported from https://github.com/geewiz/rabbitmq_ada.
                    Created this file (README).
                    Extracted COPYING from rabbitmq-c_binding.ads.
                    Fixed deprecated includes in rabbitmq_ada_helpers.c.
                    Added pragma Link_With("-lrabbitmq") and
                    pragma Link_With("-lsimpleio") to rabbitmq-c_binding.ads.

23 December 2025 -- Added local extensions package RabbitMQ.Munts.
                    Patch rabbitmq-client-urls.adb.
                    (See https://github.com/geewiz/rabbitmq_ada/issues/1)

26 December 2025 -- Edited rabbitmq_ada_helpers.c to mark the external function
                    amqp_login() as weak, so that programs such as test_led.adb
                    can be linked without librabbitmq.so.  Bona fide RabbitMQ
                    client programs, such as test_rabbitmq_produce.adb,
                    explicitly link librabbitmq.so and thus satisfy the symbol
                    reference to amqp_login().

29 December 2025 -- Changed the default exchange to amqp.topic and added support
                    for the RABBITMQ_ROUTING environment variable to package
                    RabbitMQ.Munts.
