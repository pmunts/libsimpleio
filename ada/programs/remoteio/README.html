<h1>Ada Remote I/O Client Programs</h1>
<p>The query programs illustrate six different methods of communicating with a
<a href="http://git.munts.com/libsimpleio/doc/RemoteIOProtocol.pdf">Remote I/O
Protocol</a> server: Four variations of raw HID (Human Interface Device) plus
serial port and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).</p>
<p>The device test programs all use raw HID via the <a href=
"https://github.com/signal11/hidapi">HIDAPI</a> library, the most portable of
the four raw HID variations. They will compile and run on Linux, MacOS, and
Windows client computers. Unfortunately, they will not work on a <a href=
"http://git.munts.com/arm-linux-mcu">MuntsOS</a> <b>client</b> computer, as
MuntsOS does not currently support <tt>libhidapi</tt>. Use <tt>libsimpleio</tt>
instead, as illustrated in <tt>test_query_hid.adb</tt>.</p>
<p>On all Posix systems, use <tt>make</tt> to compile the test programs. I use
<a href="https://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> <tt>make</tt> on Windows as well,
but if you don't have and don't want Cygwin on your Windows system, you can use
the script command files <tt>compile.cmd</tt> and <tt>clean.cmd</tt>
instead.</p>
<p>(These test programs can actually be compiled with the Cygwin native GNAT
toolchain, but suffer a number of run time issues.)</p>
