<h1>Ada MCP2221A Client Programs</h1>
<p>These programs are for exercising and validating the <a href=
"https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/MCP2221A">MCP2221</a> device support
packages. All except <tt>test_query_libsimpleio</tt> use raw HID via the
<a href="https://github.com/signal11/hidapi">HIDAPI</a> library to communicate
with the MCP2221A. They will compile and run on Linux, MacOS, and Windows
client computers. Unfortunately, they will not work on a <a href=
"http://git.munts.com/arm-linux-mcu">MuntsOS</a> <b>client</b> computer, as
MuntsOS does not currently support <tt>libhidapi</tt>. Use <tt>libsimpleio</tt>
instead, as illustrated in <tt>test_query_libsimpleio.adb</tt>.</p>
<p>On all Posix systems, use <tt>make</tt> to compile the test programs. I use
<a href="https://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> <tt>make</tt> on Windows as well,
but if you don't have and don't want Cygwin on your Windows system, you can use
the script command files <tt>compile.cmd</tt> and <tt>clean.cmd</tt>
instead.</p>
