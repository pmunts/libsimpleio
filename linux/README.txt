Linux Shared Libraries
----------------------

The Linux shared libraries stored here are provided for the convenience of
developers who are using tools on a MacOS or Windows computer (e.g. Visual
Studio) to develop applications to run on Linux target computers.

Shared libraries are provided here for the following Linux targets:

* Debian 12 (Bookworm) amd64 (aka x86-64).
* Debian 12 (Bookworm) arm64 (aka AArch64).
* MuntsOS Embedded Linux for AArch64 (Raspberry Pi 3 et al).
* MuntsOS Embedded Linux for RISCV64.

You will need to manually copy the appropiate shared library to
/usr/local/lib on each target computer.
