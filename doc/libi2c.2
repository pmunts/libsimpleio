.SH DESCRIPTION
All functions return either
.B 0
(upon success) or an
.B errno
value (upon failure) in
.IR *error .
.PP
.B I2C_open()
opens an I2C bus controller device.  The device name,
.BR /dev/i2c-x ,
must be passed in the
.IR name
parameter. Upon success, a file descriptor for the
I2C bus controller device is retured in
.IR *fd .
.PP
.B I2C_close()
closes a previously opened I2C bus controller device.
.PP
.B I2C_transaction()
performs a single I2C bus transaction, with optional transmit and receive
phases.  The I2C slave device address must be passed in the
.I slaveaddr
parameter.  Either the address of a command message and its length must be passed in the
.IR cmd " and " cmdlen
parameters, or
.BR NULL " and " 0
for a receive only transaction.  Either the address of a receive buffer and its size must be passed in the
.IR resp " and " resplen
parameters, or
.BR NULL " and " 0
for a transmit only transaction.
