.SH DESCRIPTION
.nh
All functions return either
.B 0
(upon success) or an
.B errno
value (upon failure) in
.IR *error .
.PP
.BR HIDRAW_open1() " opens a raw HID device by name.  The device node name (" /dev/hidrawN ")"
must be passed in
.IR name .
Upon success, a file descriptor for the raw HID device is returned in
.IR *fd .
.PP
.BR HIDRAW_open2() " opens the first raw HID device
that matches the vendor ID and product ID passed in
.IR VID " and " PID .
Upon success, a file descriptor for the raw hid device is returned in
.IR *fd .
.PP
.BR HIDRAW_open3() " opens the raw HID device
that matches the vendor ID, product ID, and serial number passed in
.IR VID ", " PID ", and " serial .
Upon success, a file descriptor for the raw hid device is returned in
.IR *fd .
.PP
.B HIDRAW_close()
closes a previously opened raw HID device.
The HID device file descriptor must be passed in
.IR fd .
.PP
.B HIDRAW_get_name()
fetches an information string from the raw HID device.
The HID device file descriptor must be passed in
.IR fd .
The destination buffer address must be passed in
.I *name
and the destination buffer size must be passed in
.IR namesize .
The minimum size for the destination buffer is 16 bytes.
.PP
.B HIDRAW_get_info()
fetches the bus type, vendor ID and product ID from the raw HID device.
The HID device file descriptor must be passed in
.IR fd .
The bus
type is returned in
.IR *bustype ,
and may be
.BR BUS_USB ,
.BR BUS_HIL ,
.BR BUS_BLUETOOTH " or"
.BR BUS_VIRTUAL .
These values are defined in
.BR /usr/include/linux/input.h .
The vendor and product ID's are returned in
.IR *vendor  " and " *product " respectively."
.PP
.B HIDRAW_send()
sends a message (also known as a HID report) to the raw HID device.
The HID device file descriptor must be passed in
.IR fd .
The address of the message buffer must be passed in
.IR buf
and the size of the message buffer must be passed in
.IR bufsize .
The message size will typically be either 64 or 65 bytes, depending on whether the
particular raw HID device uses the first byte for the report number.  Upon success,
the number of bytes actually sent will be returned in
.IR *count .
.PP
.B HIDRAW_receive()
receives a message (i.e. a HID report) from the raw HID device.
The HID device file descriptor must be passed in
.IR fd .
The address of the message buffer must be passed in
.IR buf
and the size of the message buffer must be passed in
.IR bufsize .
The message size will typically be either 64 or 65 bytes, depending on whether the
particular raw HID device uses the first byte for the report number.  Upon success,
the number of bytes actually received will be returned in
.IR *count .
