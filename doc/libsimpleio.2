.SH NAME
.BR libsimpleio
\-\- Linux Simple I/O Library
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR libsimpleio
is an attempt to encapsulate (as much as possible) the ugliness of Linux I/O
device access. It provides services for the following types of I/O devices:
.IP * 2
GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) Pins
.IP * 2
Raw HID (Human Interface Device) Devices
.IP * 2
I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) Bus Devices
.IP * 2
Serial Ports
.IP * 2
SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) Bus Devices
.PP
Although
.BR libsimpleio
was originally intended for Linux microcomputers such as the Raspberry Pi,
it can also be useful on larger desktop Linux systems (particularly
the raw HID and serial port services).
