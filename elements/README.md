RemObjects Elements Test Programs
=================================

[RemObjects Elements](https://www.elementscompiler.com/elements) is a
commercial cross-platform development environment for the Oxygene (an
object oriented Pascal dialect), C\#, Java, and Swift programming
languages, targeting Android, Java byte code, .Net, and Web Assembly as
well as native Linux, native MacOS and native Windows platforms.

Here are some *Visual Studio 2022* project templates and example
projects for developing platform neutral .Net 6 applications using
the `libsimpleio` and `libremoteio` library packages published on
[NuGet](https://www.nuget.org).

The simplest way to begin developing such an applications is to download
one or more of the project templates and copy it to

`%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\Documents\Visual Studio 2022\Templates`.

Then you can create a new project within *Visual Studio 2022* using one
of the templates.
