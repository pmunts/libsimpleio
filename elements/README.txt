                       RemObjects Elements Test Programs

   [1]RemObjects Elements is a commercial cross-platform development
   environment for the Oxygene (an object oriented Pascal dialect), C#,
   Java, and Swift programming languages, targeting Android, Java byte
   code, .Net, and Web Assembly as well as native Linux, native MacOS and
   native Windows platforms.

   Here are some Visual Studio 2019 project templates and example projects
   for developing platform neutral .Net 5 applications using the
   libsimpleio and libremoteio library packages published on [2]NuGet.

   The simplest way to begin developing such an applications is to
   download one or more of the project templates and copy it to

   %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\Documents\Visual Studio 2019\Templates.

   Then you can create a new project within Visual Studio 2019 using one
   of the templates.
