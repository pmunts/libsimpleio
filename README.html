<h1>Linux Simple I/O Library</h1>
<p><b>libsimpleio</b> is an attempt to encapsulate (as much as possible) the
ugliness of Linux I/O device access. It provides services for the following
types of I/O devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) Pins</li>
<li>Raw HID (Human Interface Device) Devices</li>
<li>I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) Bus Devices</li>
<li><a href=

LINX Remote I/O</a> Devices</li>
<li>Serial Ports</li>
<li>SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) Bus Devices</li>
<li><a href=
"http://git.munts.com/libsimpleio/doc/StreamFramingProtocol.pdf">Stream Framing
Protocol</a> Devices</li>
<li>TCP (over IPv4) Network Devices</li>
</ul>
<p>Although <b>libsimpleio</b> was originally intended for Linux microcomputers
such as the Raspberry Pi, it can also be useful on larger desktop Linux
systems.</p>
