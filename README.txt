                            Linux Simple I/O Library

   libsimpleio is an attempt to encapsulate (as much as possible) the
   ugliness of Linux I/O device access. It provides services for the
   following types of I/O devices:

     * GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) Pins
     * Raw HID (Human Interface Device) Devices
     * I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) Bus Devices
     * Serial Ports
     * SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) Bus Devices

   Although libsimpleio was originally intended for Linux microcomputers
   such as the Raspberry Pi, it can also be useful on larger desktop Linux
   systems (particularly the raw HID and serial port services).
